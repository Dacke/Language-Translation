Language Translation Utility
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project has been designed to be used by developers who have a need to globalize their solution through the use of resource files.  The idea is that English resource file is used as a template to go through and get the individual translations of each word or phrase so that it can be translated into the specified language.

Step 1:
Create your English string resource file with all of the words that you want to translate.

Step 2:
Create a new Blank string resource file for the language that you want to translate your data into.

Step 3:
Check the "Use Google for the translation engine" check box and select the specified language and click Translate

Step 4:
Have your translated values check (or do it yourself) to make sure that they make sense in the context of the application.

Step 5:
Use the blank *.xls (or *.xlsx) file template to add any corrections to the translation that you want.

Step 6:
Run the application again, this time browse for your translations file and click Translate.  

The application should prompt you before overwriting any translations that already exist in the file that do not match the translated value.

Please if you have any improvements, fork this project and then submit a pull request.  This is version 1.0 of the software and may not provide all of the needed functionality.

New Features:
* The solution now takes care of unicode requests.  It can handle more languages that before!
* If you translate a file, it will take the translated keys that match the source document and export them to an Excel spreadsheet.  This would enable you to send the Excel file to a human to perform the final "in context" translation and correct any errors.  This Excel file can then be selected in the "Translation File" field to overwrite the values in the target file.
